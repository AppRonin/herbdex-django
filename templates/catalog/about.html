          <p>
            <strong>Herbdex</strong> is a searchable catalog of medicinal herbs,
            created as a digital apothecary to organize and store knowledge
            about natural remedies, traditional uses, and plant-based
            treatments.
          </p>

          <p>
            The goal is simple: make it easy to look up herbs by
            <strong>name</strong> or by <strong>illness/medical use</strong>,
            and keep structured notes about what each herb can do.

            This project was built as a personal learning tool — a place to
            store, review, and expand knowledge about medicinal herbs over time.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-0">
            It works like a growing notebook: each herb added represents
            something studied, reviewed, or researched.
